    <h1 class="title"> German for English-Speaking Programmers </h1>
    <div class="content"> 

<p>After 2 years of learning German I&rsquo;ve noticed that, for the most part, you can
go a long way by mapping foreign concepts to ones that you already know. In
particular, I&rsquo;ve had success mapping aspects of German grammar to programming
concepts I use every day. After all, programmers deal with weird grammars all
the time, why not take advantage of that skill?</p>

<h3 id="gendered-nouns-forward-error-correction">Gendered nouns: forward error correction</h3>

<p>Probably the first difficulty people run into when leaning German is memorizing
the gender of each noun and <a href="https://i.redd.it/hotye1wdbg511.jpg">properly declining</a> that noun&rsquo;s articles
when used in a sentence. While the grammar is mostly regular here, two things
make this challenging: the nonsensical assignment of genders to nouns<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:genders"><a href="#fn:genders">1</a></sup>
and the sheer amount of memorization required to select the correct declension
once the gender of the noun is known.</p>

<p>While no amount of explanation can fully console someone going through this
process, I&rsquo;ve made peace with gendered nouns by treating them as a form of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_error_correction">forward error correction</a>. Forward error correction is an encoding
technique that adds extra &ldquo;redundant&rdquo; information to a message such that if
parts of the message are lost or garbled, the extra information can be used to
reconstruct the original message <em>without</em> having to ask the sender to
retransmit.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever had to attach words to letters to spell something complicated
over the phone (S, T as in Tom, I, P as in Peter, I, C as in Charlie, &hellip;) you
understand forward error correction. Underlying these methods
are an agreed-upon set of rules that both sender and receiver know (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
to say a word that we both know, and the letter I&rsquo;m trying to communicate to you
will be the first letter in that word&rdquo;). A more formal &ldquo;code&rdquo; would involve
agreeing to always use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet">NATO phonetic alphabet</a> when spelling
things out over the phone. If you heard &ldquo;{garbled}-ELTA,&rdquo; you can guess that
the sender said &ldquo;Delta&rdquo; because the rules were such that the sender couldn&rsquo;t
have said anything else (no other letter&rsquo;s pronunciation ends in &ldquo;elta&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Computers use a more complicated version of this to
protect bitstreams against different kinds of errors.
The &ldquo;rules that both sender and receiver know&rdquo; can be
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming(7,4)#Hamming_matrices">Hamming Matrices</a> <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:hamming-explain"><a href="#fn:hamming-explain">2</a></sup>,
<a href="http://pfister.ee.duke.edu/courses/ecen604/rspoly.pdf">Reed-Solomon polynomials</a> <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:reed-solomon-explain"><a href="#fn:reed-solomon-explain">3</a></sup>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_code">Markov Chains</a> <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:convolutional-explain"><a href="#fn:convolutional-explain">4</a></sup>, or modifications and
combinations of all of these.</p>

<p>The genders of individual nouns and the grammatical rules to decline articles
and adjectives using those genders constitute <em>a shared set of rules that the
sender and receiver both know</em>. It may not approach the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noisy-channel_coding_theorem">Shannon limit</a>, but German gendered nouns form a weird, organically
developed forward error correcting code. This might be a convoluted (lol)
example, but imagine trying to hear the difference between &ldquo;Rat&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rad&rdquo; over
a bad phone line. Your brain has to do this kind of reconstruction all the time,
you&rsquo;re just not usually conscious of it! &ldquo;Gib mir das Ra{d,t}&rdquo; makes the
distinction clear &ndash; a German speaker would decode it as &ldquo;das Rad&rdquo; immediately,
because that &ldquo;just sounds right.&rdquo; The declinations are just parity bits in the
sentence, and the &ldquo;just sounds right&rdquo; is the error-free solution to the parity
equation.</p>

<ol>
<li id="fn:genders"><p><em>Der Junge</em>, boy, is masculine. <em>Das Mädchen</em>, girl, is neutral.
<em>Die Männlichkeit</em>, masculinity, is female.</p>
 <a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:genders"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>

<li id="fn:hamming-explain"><p>Mix the bits into overlapping checksums so if one checksum
fails, you can reconstruct the original bit from the other checksums.</p>
 <a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:hamming-explain"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>

<li id="fn:reed-solomon-explain"><p>Encode the data as a polynomial, then send points that
sit on that polynomial such that you can reconstruct the polynomial from the
points received. By sending way more points than necessary you can correctly
reconstruct the original polynomial even if some points are missing or altered.</p>
 <a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:reed-solomon-explain"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>

<li id="fn:convolutional-explain"><p>Convolutional codes repeatedly mix new data with
previously emitted data. There are a few ways to decode this, but the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_algorithm">Viterbi algorithm</a> is pretty cool &ndash; you use dynamic programming
to reconstruct the input (represented as a path through a Markov chain)
that was most likely to have generated the observed output (the convolved
and emitted data). This works even if that output was emitted unreliably.</p>
