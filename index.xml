      <description>After 2 years of learning German I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that, for the most part, you can go a long way by mapping foreign concepts to ones that you already know. In particular, I&amp;rsquo;ve had success mapping aspects of German grammar to programming concepts I use every day. After all, programmers deal with weird grammars all the time, why not take advantage of that skill?
Gendered nouns: forward error correction Probably the first difficulty people run into when leaning German is memorizing the gender of each noun and properly declining that noun&amp;rsquo;s articles when used in a sentence.</description>

      <title>On Pizza</title>

      <description>Today I learned that my calorie-tracking app thinks that I eat fewer calories on days I eat pizza than on days I don&amp;rsquo;t. Unfortunately I think this is a due to a lack of data (it&amp;rsquo;s only basing this off of about 11 days of tracking). Even if it were true, correlation isn&amp;rsquo;t causation. Still, I won&amp;rsquo;t turn down an excuse to eat more pizza.</description>
